/**
 * https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinequery
 * This object represents an incoming inline query. When the user sends an empty query, your bot could return some default or trending results.
 * @typedef {Object} InlineQuery
 * @property {string} id - Unique identifier for this query
 * @property {User} from - Sender
 * @property {string} query - Text of the query (up to 256 characters)
 * @property {string} offset - Offset of the results to be returned, can be controlled by the bot
 * @property {InlineQueryChatType} [chat_type] - Optional. Type of the chat from which the inline query was sent. Can be either "sender" for a private chat with the inline query sender, "private", "group", "supergroup", or "channel". The chat type should be always known for requests sent from official clients and most third-party clients, unless the request was sent from a secret chat
 * @property {Location} [location] - Optional. Sender location, only for bots that request user location

 * @typedef {Object} InlineQueryResultsButton
 * @property {string} text - Label text on the button
 * @property {WebAppInfo} [web_app] - Optional. Description of the Web App that will be launched when the user presses the button. The Web App will be able to switch back to the inline mode using the method switchInlineQuery inside the Web App.
 * @property {string} [start_parameter] - Optional. Deep-linking parameter for the /start message sent to the bot when a user presses the button. 1-64 characters, only A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _ and - are allowed. Example: An inline bot that sends YouTube videos can ask the user to connect the bot to their YouTube account to adapt search results accordingly. To do this, it displays a 'Connect your YouTube account' button above the results, or even before showing any. The user presses the button, switches to a private chat with the bot and, in doing so, passes a start parameter that instructs the bot to return an OAuth link. Once done, the bot can offer a switch_inline button so that the user can easily return to the chat where they wanted to use the bot's inline capabilities.
